# Calculating the Sum of Two Variables
Here we will calculate the sum of two variables.

```{r sum_calculations, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

#assigning values to variables and printing the sum
a <- 3
b <- 2
a + b

#using the sum function to calculate the sum of the two assigned variables
sum(a, b)

```

# American Airlines Departure Delay vs. Arrival Delay Plot

```{r plot_AAdata, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)
nycflights13::flights

#This filters the American Airlines flights and assigns it to "AA_flights"
(AA_flights <- filter(flights, carrier == "AA"))

ggplot(data = AA_flights) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)) +
  labs(title = "Departure Delay vs. Arrival Delay", x = "Departure Delay", y = "Arriva Delay")

```
