We will be looking at the popularity of the name "Daniel" over time, and when it reached its peak popularity

# Load Library

We first want to open the library we want to work with. For this homework, I decided to use the babynames package. 

```{r load_package, message=FALSE}

library(babynames)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```
# Plot

This is where we plot the data. 
```{r plot_data, message=FALSE}
#filter out the data from the package
dataset_1 <- filter(babynames, name == "Daniel", sex == "M")

#plot out filtered data and name axes
ggplot(data = dataset_1) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y =n)) + 
  labs (title = "Popularity of Daniel over time", x = "Year", y = "Number of People")

```

# Conclusion

From the data, we can see that the name, "Daniel", has increased in popularity since the 1880s. It peaked in popularity around the late 1900s.
